# Standardized Project Structure

This repository works as a directory structure template upon which Data Science and Machine Learning projects are going to be based. The main goal is to achieve a standardized structure for all projects in order to build institutional knowledge across the organization.

The folder structure is organized according to TDSP - Team Data Science Project - lifecycle.
