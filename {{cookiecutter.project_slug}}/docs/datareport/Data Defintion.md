# Data and Feature Definitions

This document provides a central hub for the raw data sources, the processed/transformed data, and feature sets. More details of each dataset is provided in the data summary report. 

For each data, an individual report describing the data schema, the meaning of each data field, and other information that is helpful for understanding the data is provided. If the dataset is the output of processing/transforming/feature engineering existing data set(s), the names of the input data sets, and the links to scripts that are used to conduct the operation are also provided. 

## Raw Data Sources


| Dataset Name | Original Location   | Destination Location  | Data Movement Tools / Scripts | Link to Report |
| ---:| ---: | ---: | ---: | -----: |
| Dataset 1 | Brief description of its orignal location | Brief description of its destination location | [script1.py](link/to/python/script/file/in/Code) | [Dataset 1 Report](link/to/report1)|
| Dataset 2 | Brief description of its orignal location | Brief description of its destination location | [script2.R](link/to/R/script/file/in/Code) | [Dataset 2 Report](link/to/report2)|

## Processed Data
| Processed Dataset Name | Input Dataset(s)   | Data Processing Tools/Scripts | Link to Report |
| ---:| ---: | ---: | ---: | 
| Processed Dataset 1 | [Dataset1](link/to/dataset1/report), [Dataset2](link/to/dataset2/report) | [Python_Script1.py](link/to/python/script/file/in/Code) | [Processed Dataset 1 Report](link/to/report1)|

+ Describe the data pipeline and provide a logical diagram. List how frequently the data is moved - real time/stream, near real time, batched with frequency etc.
